# ArduinoUnoClone
PCB design of an Arduino Uno clone.

### Description
The clone was made in mind with the possibility of the board to be realised in a DYI fashion, there are few small SMD components which should be somewhat easily be soldered to the board. This design omits the inclusion of an on-board programmer, that need to be plugged into the connector annotated with J7. Power delivery is on a separate 2 pin connector (J5). Otherwise, this should function the same as any Arduino Uno board that is commercially available.

### Additional notes
This project was made with KiCad, project files included are the schematics and the PCB design.
